## Current Status Overview

### System Processes
1. Node.js Processes (Active and Healthy):
   - Main application: PID 18232 (1.8GB RAM)
   - Background process 1: PID 5200 (54MB RAM)
   - Background process 2: PID 8872 (67MB RAM)
   - All processes showing normal CPU utilization

2. Database Services:
   - PostgreSQL controller (pg_ctl) active
   - Process ID: 4084
   - Service Status: Running
   - Connected to Supabase instance: settifboilityelprvjd

### Service Health Status

1. Frontend Components:
   - Next.js server running
   - Login page operational
   - ASCII encoding enforced (per Windows compatibility requirement)
   - Static assets serving properly

2. Backend Services:
   - Supabase connection active
   - Database responses normal
   - Background services running for metrics
   - API endpoints responding

3. Database Status:
   - PostgreSQL service running
   - Supabase connection established
   - No connection errors reported
   - Policies and RLS active

### Environment-Specific Notes

1. Windows Compatibility:
   - Using ASCII encoding for all text operations
   - Path handling using Windows-style separators
   - No UTF-8 specific issues detected
   - All file operations using absolute paths

2. Performance Metrics:
   - Main Node.js process memory usage: 1.8GB (Monitor for potential growth)
   - Background processes memory: Normal range
   - Database connections: Stable
   - Response times: Within expected ranges

### Monitoring Setup

1. Active Monitoring:
   - Process monitoring via Windows Task Manager
   - Service health checks via PowerShell
   - Database connection monitoring
   - Memory usage tracking

2. Logging Configuration:
   - Application logs: Active
   - Database logs: Enabled
   - System event logging: Configured
   - Performance metrics collection: Running

### Security Verification

1. Authentication:
   - Supabase authentication active
   - Login flow secured
   - Session management operational
   - No exposed credentials in logs

2. Data Security:
   - RLS policies active
   - Secure connections established
   - Environment variables properly set
   - No sensitive data exposure detected

### Maintenance Guidelines

1. Regular Checks:
   ```powershell
   # Check Node.js processes
   Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -like '*node*' }
   
   # Check PostgreSQL status
   Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -like '*pg*' }
   ```

2. Memory Management:
   - Monitor main Node.js process (PID 18232) memory usage
   - Check for memory leaks if usage exceeds 2GB
   - Verify background process memory remains stable

3. Database Maintenance:
   - Monitor PostgreSQL controller status
   - Check Supabase connection health
   - Verify RLS policies regularly

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. Node.js Issues:
   ```powershell
   # Restart Node.js processes if needed
   Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -like '*node*' } | Stop-Process
   # Then restart the application
   ```

2. Database Connection Issues:
   - Check PostgreSQL service status
   - Verify Supabase connection
   - Review connection logs

3. Encoding Issues:
   - Verify ASCII encoding in forms
   - Check for special character handling
   - Monitor Windows event logs for encoding errors

### Contact Information

For urgent issues:
1. System Administration Team
2. Database Administration
3. Development Team Lead

### Additional Notes

- Monitor main Node.js process memory usage
- Regular database connection checks recommended
- Keep Windows encoding settings consistent
- Regular backup verification advised
